# Dim Bot
## An open source bot with all the features from Dim!
#### This is a open source version of Dim, Including the Normal and Mini package, This GitHub repository only includes instructions into getting the bot up and running!



## Important Note:
**All code of Dim are in the releases page! Do not download the files called Source code, Download the files called DimBotOSSRC.zip! Those files contain the actual code!**

_DIM OPEN SOURCE IS NOT THE SAME AS DIM PUBLIC! DIM PUBLIC IS CLOSED SOURCED AND IT'S UNIQUE FEATURES WILL NOT BE COMING TO DIM OPEN SOURCE_
